## 🎯 Project Description

SignSpeak is an innovative on-device AI application that provides real-time sign language translation, breaking down communication barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Leveraging Qualcomm's powerful edge AI capabilities, SignSpeak performs all processing locally, ensuring:

- **Ultra-low latency** (<50ms) for natural conversations
- **Complete privacy** - no video data leaves the device
- **Offline functionality** - works anywhere, anytime
- **Bi-directional translation** - sign-to-speech and speech-to-sign

### Key Features

- 🤟 Real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition
- 🗣️ Text-to-speech output with natural voice synthesis
- 📱 Optimized for Qualcomm Snapdragon processors
- 🔒 Privacy-first architecture with on-device processing
- 📊 Support for 100+ common ASL signs (expandable)
- 🌐 Multi-language support for translated text
- 📈 Continuous learning from user corrections
- ♿ Accessibility-focused UI/UX design

## 📚 Notes & Additional Information

### Technical Innovations

1. **Adaptive Frame Skipping:** Dynamically adjusts processing based on movement detection
2. **Gesture Smoothing:** Temporal filtering to reduce false positives
3. **Context-Aware Translation:** Uses previous signs to improve accuracy
4. **Power-Efficient Mode:** Reduces inference frequency during static scenes

### Future Enhancements

- Support for more sign languages (BSL, ISL, etc.)
- Two-handed sign recognition
- Facial expression analysis for emotional context
- AR overlay for learning mode
- Collaborative dictionary building

### Known Limitations

- Currently supports single-handed signs only
